# git pull

Similar to a [git push](./Push.md), a `git pull` will interact with a rem ote repository. Only this time it will **pull** the changes it doesn't have from the remote down and added to the local repository.

This can be dome by adding the remote name and branch name:

```
git pull origin main
```

If there is any upstream connection established, you can use `git pull` without specifying a remote or branch.
